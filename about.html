                            <p>"In both the Rosenkavalier Suite and the performance of Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks that closed the evening, one was impressed anew at Kirov's conducting. No matter what the repertoire, Kirov always seems to find the perfect tempo giusto. While he draws playing of great vitality and dynamism, his supple, flexible direction never indulges in extremes or theatricality for its own sake and is always put wholly at the service of the score at hand."</p>

                            <p>"...the playing of the IPO under Stilian Kirov was consistently impressive—polished, strongly projected, and bristling with virtuosic energy. As Kirov begins his third season as music director, it is clear that the young maestro is taking his southwest suburban orchestra to a new and exciting level."</p>
